<h3>Mitch Taylor - s3915730</h3>
<p>I previously studied a Bachelor of Paramedicine but decided I wanted to switch to information technology as it’s always been an interest of mine.
   I love music (techno, deep house, trance), enjoy playing video games, watching movies and television, and going to the gym.</p>

   <h3>Dat Nguyen - s3697380</h3>
   <p>I am currently doing a Bachelor of International Business at RMIT University. I am a transfer student from Vietnam, and I am going to graduate after this semester.
     I can speak English, Vietnamese, and French. Moreover, I also have a part-time job delivering food in Melbourne City.
     On the other hand, I used to be a gamer addicted when I spent nearly a day just playing League of Legends, but when I grew up and found that I have a better hobby is playing soccer,
     and until now I am in the RMIT University soccer team. At the moment, I hope that the Covid-19 pandemic will end soon so I can book a flight ticket to visit my parents.</p>

     <h3>Jake Porter - s3909096</h3>
     <p>I am currently 22, graduated high school in 2016 and went straight into studying Engineering at University of Queensland. I did my first year there but did not overly enjoy
        Engineering and therefore transferred to QUT (Queensland University of Technology), to major in electrical and aerospace engineering. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I still did not enjoy what I was studying and decided to pick another career path; I followed wrong advice from my career’s counsellor at QUT and did a year of a
          Bachelor of Justice until I moved down to Melbourne in January of 2021 and took up a Bachelor of IT, hoping to major in cyber security. </p>
          <p>During the back and forth of finding a degree I wanted to pursue, I managed to work full time here and there, complete a Certificate 3 in Civil Construction and get work
            experience in many different industries. I was able to fund many of my hobbies which included building my own computer, anything to do with my cars and visiting as many pubs as possible.
            I like to think the choice to prioritise work over studying taught me the importance of getting a degree. While the money was good for a short period of time, career progression really
             became for my future. By 22, I have lived out of home for 4 years, had 5 different cars, been engaged, travelled and experienced things that just wouldn’t be possible
             if I chose to prioritise study. Beyond all this, I love photography, although I have never pursued it, I have many favourites of my own work which I like to share on Instagram.</p>

      <h3>Anson Guang Ping Go - s3767707</h3>
      <p>I am currently studying my bachelor’s degree at RMIT in Melbourne, 3000 VIC, Australia. I was born on 17 September 1998 and finished my high school education in Malaysia.
        I enjoy reading novels and playing multiplayer battle online games during my free time. I was once a swimming athlete but had to retire to continue my study. My highest achievement is
        competing in the ASEAN university games. I am interested in cooking, and I am more likely to become a food blogger if not working in the IT industry in the future.</p>
