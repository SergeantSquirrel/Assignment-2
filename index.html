<h2>Mitch Taylor - s3915730</h2>
<p>I previously studied a Bachelor of Paramedicine but decided I wanted to switch to information technology as it’s always been an interest of mine.
   I love music (techno, deep house, trance), enjoy playing video games, watching movies and television, and going to the gym.</p>
   <h3><strong>My Ideal Job - Senior Java Developer</strong></h3>
   <p>This position involves working directly with the designing and developing of web applications using java technologies, development of frameworks, and team management.
     A senior developer position currently appeals to me as I enjoy problem solving, so being able to keep my mind active by having problems and issues to solve daily is desirable.
     Being directly involved in the design and development process is important to me as I would like to be working on projects, in addition to being in a position to provide advice to others.</p>
<p>Learning opportunities and career advancement are also available, such as moving to a project management role or team leader roles. The pay rate is usually pretty reasonable for the work done,
  with work life balance presumably being reasonable as it's a government funded organisation.</p>

   <h2>Dat Nguyen - s3697380</h2>
   <p>I am currently doing a Bachelor of International Business at RMIT University. I am a transfer student from Vietnam, and I am going to graduate after this semester.
     I can speak English, Vietnamese, and French. Moreover, I also have a part-time job delivering food in Melbourne City.
     On the other hand, I used to be a gamer addicted when I spent nearly a day just playing League of Legends, but when I grew up and found that I have a better hobby is playing soccer,
     and until now I am in the RMIT University soccer team. At the moment, I hope that the Covid-19 pandemic will end soon so I can book a flight ticket to visit my parents.</p>
     <h3><strong>My Ideal Job - Management Accountant</strong></h3>
     <p>As I am currently studying for a Bachelor of International Business (IB) major, there are numerous kinds of jobs such as the Business Development Manager, the Senior Financial Manager,
       and the Management Accountant. Among them, I am very much looking forward to becoming a Management Accountant. This industry requires me to have monthly management reports prepared to track
       financial performance against the budget-making comments on management reports. Cash flow projections are created-variance analysis of actual outcomes vs budget and prediction for each profit
       and cost center. The business analyst role is responsible for delivering proactive and effective financial assistance and guidance to operational teams that respond to a grasp of operational
       and economic imperatives. The job is an outstanding opportunity for an emerging candidate to grow and progress with one of the most recognized businesses in the industry and be part of a
       collaborative team. As an international business student, I believe that I have sufficient skills or knowledge of Australian and International Financial Reporting Standards to improve my
       skills in Microsoft Excel. To be better in my ideal job, I think that at least I must know a number of IT works, which is why I want to study IT. In addition, I have good speaking and
       writing skills and the attention to detail that a company offers. I always want to develop myself and a business in general.</p>


     <h2>Jake Porter - s3909096</h2>
     <p>I am currently 22, graduated high school in 2016 and went straight into studying Engineering at University of Queensland. I did my first year there but did not overly enjoy
        Engineering and therefore transferred to QUT (Queensland University of Technology), to major in electrical and aerospace engineering. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I still did not enjoy what I was studying and decided to pick another career path; I followed wrong advice from my career’s counsellor at QUT and did a year of a
          Bachelor of Justice until I moved down to Melbourne in January of 2021 and took up a Bachelor of IT, hoping to major in cyber security. </p>
          <p>During the back and forth of finding a degree I wanted to pursue, I managed to work full time here and there, complete a Certificate 3 in Civil Construction and get work
            experience in many different industries. I was able to fund many of my hobbies which included building my own computer, anything to do with my cars and visiting as many pubs as possible.
            I like to think the choice to prioritise work over studying taught me the importance of getting a degree. While the money was good for a short period of time, career progression really
             became for my future. By 22, I have lived out of home for 4 years, had 5 different cars, been engaged, travelled and experienced things that just wouldn’t be possible
             if I chose to prioritise study. Beyond all this, I love photography, although I have never pursued it, I have many favourites of my own work which I like to share on Instagram.</p>

         <h3><strong>My Ideal Job - Cyber Security Operations Specialist with Boeing Defence Australia</strong></h3>
         <p>The specialist role is directly involved with their current Currawong project. The Currawong project is ‘an integrated Battlefield Telecommunications Network system’ (JP 2072 Project
           Currawong).
           It is a revolutionised communication network that allows direct video and audio transmission with Australia’s headquarters and troops deployed around the globe.
           Boeing, who is the prime contractor for the project, is looking for an individual who can assess, analyse, and test the vulnerabilities of the network and identify solutions to mitigate the
           problems.</p>

      <h2>Anson Guang Ping Go - s3767707</h2>
      <p>I am currently studying my bachelor’s degree at RMIT in Melbourne, 3000 VIC, Australia. I was born on 17 September 1998 and finished my high school education in Malaysia.
        I enjoy reading novels and playing multiplayer battle online games during my free time. I was once a swimming athlete but had to retire to continue my study. My highest achievement is
        competing in the ASEAN university games. I am interested in cooking, and I am more likely to become a food blogger if not working in the IT industry in the future.</p>

        <h3><strong>My Ideal Job - Software Engineering Manager</strong></h3>
        <p>Since I am a fan of online multiplayer games, League of Legends is my all-time favourite video game so I would want to pursue it as a Engineering Manager of League Content Efficiency.
          I believe my passion in character and game content design pretty much suits this position and most importantly working under a desired environment contributes to a long run career although
           it can be stressful sometimes. Besides that, this position enables me to showcase my outstanding leadership and creativity in supporting my team and planning future patches to serve
           long-term goals. The job has its perks, including offering medical, dental, and vision plans that cover me, my spouse and children. Life insurance, parental leave, plus short-term and
           long-term disability coverage are also available. Furthermore, balance between work and personal life is encouraged with open paid time off, and a play fund so you can broaden and deepen
            your personal relationship with games.</p>

  <h2>Vincent Lu - s3896691</h2>
  <p>I was Previously was enrolled in the Associate Degree in Information Technology program andI completed my Victorian Certificate of Education in 2020 at Salesian College, Chadstone.
    I chose to matriculate to the Bachelor of IT degree simply for more choices in electives and a more flexible schedule allowed by the multiple lecture/tutorial sessions offered by Bachelor degrees.
    A few facts about are: I am of Chinese and Vietnamese descent , as a result of this, I am trilingual being able to speak Cantonese and Vietnamese. In my free time, I like to take my two dogs for
    walks around the block or take them to dog parks to meet other dogs.</p>
    <p>My field of interest in IT is software as the use of software has always played a large role in my life since early childhood, whether it’d be for educational or entertainment purposes.
      Discovering open-source software, I developed more respect for software developers. This respect has drawn me to aspire to reciprocate the effort put in for the greater community,
      satisfying me by making tangible difference in the life of end users.</p>

      <h3><strong>My Ideal Job - Software Developer for The Australian Government</strong></h3>
      <p>My ideal job is to be a software developer for The Australian Government Department whose responsibilities are to  analyse , design,maintain and enhance the
        software needs for various branches of the ICT division. In doing so , standards for system requirements, system designs and technical specifications need to be met.
        This position is particularly appealing to me because it doesn’t state any requirement or preference for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science/Software Engineering unlike the
        majority of listings found in seek for similar positions.</p>
