<h1>IT Work</h1>
<p>Interview with Sam Carswell who works in a Microbiological Diagnostic Unit - Public Health lab for a University in Australia. The university is unamed for confidentiality. </p>
<p>Sam studied a Bachelor of Information Technology straight after graduating from school. He always had an interest in technology growing up, so he decided to choose a career that would allow him to use his technological skills.
   The strong job prospects and income was also a strong reason that he chose IT. Currently, Sam has worked in the IT industry for five years, with three different companies. Sam started his career at InfoSys, which allowed him to be contracted and eventually full time hired by NAB, and is now working for a University.
</p>

<main>
<h2>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h2>
  <p>Sam works for the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health lab at a University in Australia . He is responsible for developing and maintaining a
    genome sequencing tracking system, which is used by the different states of Australia to share data relating to the COVID19 genome with each other.</p>

  <p>Sam has to maintain a cloud infrastructure that runs the platform (The genome sequencing tracking system) as well as spending time developing the platform.
    Equal time is spent both on maintenance and project development. </p>

  <p>The tools and technologies that Sam uses for maintenance and development include the following:</p>
  <ul>
<li>Scripting - analysis on local servers to communicate with cloud infrastructure (push information to the cloud)</li>
<li>Building and maintaining continuous integration and continuous deployment (ci/cd) pipelines</li>
<li>Management of development tools such as Github and Azure DevOps</li>
<li>Github is used for management of code repositories</li>
<li>Azure DevOps is used as a ticketing system for work, as well as an agent to run ci/cd pipelines</li>
<li>Publishing and maintenance of packages</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Sam is often required to be the first point of contact with contractors, who are hired to assist with scaling out the platform (adding additional infrastructure in prepackaged blocks).
    The contractors are given certain parameters to work within and requirements that need to be met, both of which are set by Sam, who then checks their work and signs off on it if it is satisfactory.
    As Sam is required to maintain the platform, he has to be in direct communication with users of the platform that can identify potential issues that need to be solved.</p>

  <p>As technology is constantly improving, Sam has to keep up to date with new information related to development and maintenance, as well as learning new tools that other contractors work with.
    For example, Sam had to learn how to use .NET and Blazer as the most recent contractors needed to use those specific frameworks.</p>

  <h2>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with?</h2>
  <p>Sam works with one other coworker that helps him with the maintenance and development of the platform.They often have meetings to discuss and delegate work as well as brainstorm
    solutions to issues with the platform. Other than his coworker, Sam mostly interacts with contractors (software engineers) hired to help with development. As mentioned above,
    this involves Sam setting up requirements and parameters for the contractors to work towards and within. Sam’s colleagues are Bioinformaticians, which are basically data scientists with
    medical backgrounds. They work in a different area as they focus on analysing data, which is not entirely relevant to Sam’s work. Other people Sam interacts with are epidemiologists which
    can provide him with suggestions and feedback on the development of the platform. </p>

<h2>How does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h2>
<!-- Mitch said he might add some more info here -->
<p>Majority of Sam’s time is spent in meetings with users of the platform and contractors. These meetings generally consist of the users giving feedback on the platform and listing potential issues.
  After these meetings, solutions to pressing issues have to be brainstormed and then eventually implemented. Meetings with contractors also involve Sam having to teach how certain things work as
  well as being updated on the work they've completed.</p>

 <p>A large amount of time is also spent on staying up to date on new tools and technologies relevant to the platform, as things are always being updated and changed. </p>

  <h2>What aspect of the position is most challenging?</h2>
    <p>Having to use and stay up to date with new technology frequently (almost every month), as it becomes hard to assign time during the day for self learning when he is needed for maintenance,
      development, and meetings. The example mentioned earlier of having to learn .NET and Blazer is a reason why it can be challenging.</p>

<p>Sam and one other coworker are responsible for developing and maintaining a nationally used platform by every state in Australia, which is a massive responsibility.
  Usually bigger/private companies would use two different teams for this job, a development team and a maintenance team, but due to Sam’s department being government funded, it’s not the case.</p>
