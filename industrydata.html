<h2>How do the IT specific skills rank in terms of demand?</h2>
<p>Our team’s required skill set included the top three skills in demand from employers according to the data presented from  the ‘Burning Glass Top IT Skills - March 2018’ list.
  These skills were SQL, Javascript and Java. Knowledge of business relationships, Git and Microsoft office were also featured on the Top Skills list, although at a lower demand. </p>

  <p>The additional skills that we identified did not place on the list, which were Rest API, Computer Security, Data Science, Incident Response, and Accounting Software.
    It is important to keep in mind that required tools and technology change rapidly in the IT world, causing the data presented from Burning Glass outdated as it was collected in 2018.</p>

<h2>How do the general skills rank in terms of demand?</h2>
<p>The general skills we identified as requirements for our ideal jobs featured quite frequently on the ‘Burning Glass Top Generic Skills - March 2018’ list.
  The top three skills in demand were communication, problem solving, and organisational skills. Other skills that we identified such as troubleshooting, creativity, time management,
  and analytical skills were also highly demanded. The only skill that was not present on the list was critical thinking, which could be due to its broad definition or that it is an
  expected skill, as it is definitely an essential skill for any workplace.</p>

<h2>Highest ranked skills not listed</h2>

<h2>Based off the data, have our opinions changed?</h2>
<h3><strong>Mitch - Senior Java Developer:</strong></h3>
<p>From the data gathered from Burning Glass as well as from job advertisement websites, Java Developer roles are still in high demand. My opinion on my ideal job hasn't really changed, as I am not set on being a Java Developer specifically,
  I am more interested in a general developer role, which opens up a much wider range of careers, all highly in demand. </p>

<h3><strong>Anson - IT Software Engineering Manager</strong></h3>
<p>No, my opinion of my ideal job has not changed. It is because working under desired environments contributes to a long run career although it can be stressful sometimes. I wouldn’t mind trying other jobs but being a game developer is still my
  first priority as passion and interest will keep me competitive and active in this field.</p>

<h3><strong>Jake - Cyber Security Specialist</strong></h3>
<p>Although there seems to be noticeably less jobs I am not swayed in wanting to pursue this career. Regardless of wanting a career in this industry, the threats of
  cyberspace continue to grow and I still want to be able to safely navigate it. The required skills list attributes such as critical thinking, problem solving and troubleshooting
  which are all skills I believe I possess. During my time of studying engineering, a lot of their syllabus and teaching techniques were based around problem solving and being able
  to apply knowledge to complex scenarios. It’s a skill that will be beneficial to me in real world applications and aid in achieving a career in this sector.</p>
