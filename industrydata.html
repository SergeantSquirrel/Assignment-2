<h2>How do the IT specific skills rank in terms of demand?</h2>
<p>Our team’s required skill set included the top three skills in demand from employers according to the data presented from  the ‘Burning Glass Top IT Skills - March 2018’ list.
  These skills were SQL, Javascript and Java. Knowledge of business relationships, Git and Microsoft office were also featured on the Top Skills list, although at a lower demand. </p>

  <p>The additional skills that we identified did not place on the list, which were Rest API, Computer Security, Data Science, Incident Response, and Accounting Software.
    It is important to keep in mind that required tools and technology change rapidly in the IT world, causing the data presented from Burning Glass outdated as it was collected in 2018.</p>

<h2>How do the general skills rank in terms of demand?</h2>
<p>The general skills we identified as requirements for our ideal jobs featured quite frequently on the ‘Burning Glass Top Generic Skills - March 2018’ list.
  The top three skills in demand were communication, problem solving, and organisational skills. Other skills that we identified such as troubleshooting, creativity, time management,
  and analytical skills were also highly demanded. The only skill that was not present on the list was critical thinking, which could be due to its broad definition or that it is an
  expected skill, as it is definitely an essential skill for any workplace.</p>
