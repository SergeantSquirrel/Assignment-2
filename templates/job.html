    <h1>Our Ideal Jobs</h1><br>

<h2>Mitch Taylor - <i>Senior Java Developer</i>:</h2><br>
<p>This position involves working directly with the designing and developing of web applications using java technologies, development of frameworks, and team management.
  A senior developer position currently appeals to me as I enjoy problem solving, so being able to keep my mind active by having problems and issues to solve daily is desirable.
  Being directly involved in the design and development process is important to me as I would like to be working on projects, in addition to being in a position to provide advice to others.</p>

<p>Learning opportunities and career advancement are also available, such as moving to a project management role or team leader roles. The pay rate is usually pretty reasonable for the
  work done, with work life balance presumably being reasonable as it's a government funded organisation.</p><br>

<h2>Jake Porter - <i>Cyber Security Operations Specialist</i>:</h2><br>
<p>The specialist role is directly involved with their current Currawong project. The Currawong project is ‘an integrated Battlefield Telecommunications Network system’
   (JP 2072 Project Currawong). It is a revolutionised communication network that allows direct video and audio transmission with Australia’s headquarters and troops deployed around
    the globe. Boeing, who is the prime contractor for the project, is looking for an individual who can assess, analyse, and test the vulnerabilities of the network and identify solutions
    to mitigate the problems. Though this specific position will not always be available as projects come and go, I am still determined to fill a Cyber Security role within Boeing. The majority of Boeing’s contracts are military based and coming from a military family, I am motivated to pursue this path.
</p><br>

<h2>Dat Nguyen - <i>Management Accountant</i>:</h2><br>
<p>As I am currently studying for a Bachelor of International Business (IB) major, there are numerous kinds of jobs such as the Business Development Manager, the Senior
  Financial Manager, and the Management Accountant. Among them, I am very much looking forward to becoming a Management Accountant. This industry requires me to have monthly
  management reports prepared to track financial performance against the budget-making comments on management reports. Cash flow projections are created-variance analysis of actual
  outcomes vs budget and prediction for each profit and cost center.</p>
<p>The business analyst role is responsible for delivering proactive and effective financial assistance and guidance to operational teams that respond to a grasp of operational and economic
  imperatives. The job is an outstanding opportunity for an emerging candidate to grow and progress with one of the most recognized businesses in the industry and be part of a collaborative team.
  As an international business student, I believe that I have sufficient skills or knowledge of Australian and International Financial Reporting Standards to improve my skills in Microsoft Excel.
  To be better in my ideal job, I think that at least I must know a number of IT works, which is why I want to study IT. In addition, I have good speaking and writing skills and the attention to
  detail that a company offers. I always want to develop myself and a business in general.</p><br>

<h2>Anson Go - <i>IT Software Engineering Manager:</i></h2><br>
<p>Since I am a fan of online multiplayer games, League of Legends is my all-time favourite video game so I would want to pursue it as a Engineering Manager of League Content Efficiency.
  I believe my passion in character and game content design pretty much suits this position and most importantly working under a desired environment contributes to a long run career although
  it can be stressful sometimes. Besides that, this position enables me to showcase my outstanding leadership and creativity in supporting my team and planning future patches to serve
  long-term goals.</p>
<p>The job has its perks, including offering medical, dental, and vision plans that cover me, my spouse and children. Life insurance, parental leave, plus short-term and long-term disability
  coverage are also available. Furthermore, balance between work and personal life is encouraged with open paid time off, and a play fund so you can broaden and deepen your personal relationship
  with games. This position requires a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent experience. One should have at least 3 years of working experience in an engineering
  leadership position on a team shipping large PAGE 6 large-scale, modular desktop applications and at least 6 years of software engineering experience. Furthermore, experience in developing
  software desktop applications with a heavy emphasis on data management and experience in one of the following programming languages: C/C++, Java, Go, C# are also part of the requirements
  for this job.</p><br>

<h2>Vincent Lu - <i>Software Developer</i>:</h2><br>
<p>My ideal job is to be a software developer for The Australian Government Department whose responsibilities are to  analyse , design,maintain and enhance the software needs for
  various branches of the ICT division. In doing so , standards for system requirements, system designs and technical specifications need to be met. This position is particularly appealing
  to me because it doesn’t state any requirement or preference for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science/Software Engineering unlike the majority of listings found in seek for similar positions.</p><br>

<h2>Compare and Contrast</i></h2><br>
<p>The subsequent section will cover more analytics and data on our ideal jobs however it is beneficial to compare with a grounded perspective. By titles alone there is a wide array of jobs covered amongst the team. Interestly, not all are within the IT industry itself; highlighting Dat’s management accounting dream. It's not uncommon to see crossovers with other industries in the IT sector. As Jon Lang, CEO of DDLS points out ‘the simple fact is, there are nowhere near enough skilled professionals coming out of universities to fulfill all the IT roles needed in Australian organisations.’ As a result, it’s highly favoured and common to see other industries pursuing basic IT knowledge and skill to be able to relieve the demand on the IT sector.</p>
<p>It's important to highlight the importance of our personality results and the personal information given by the team members. No one person is the same as another; our interests, life circumstances, upbringing and the people around us are all contributing factors to who we are. It’s all relevant because to compare our ideal jobs, would be to compare us as individuals.</p>
<p>Focusing towards the personality results. It’s important to know and understand what they mean. In a group environment (this assessment included), understanding these results will help in developing your role within a team. Some are quiet, some are loud, some learn best through visuals, some like to take charge and others like to be given an independent task. It's not only helpful in understanding your role and how you work within a group environment, it’s helpful to those who work best in leadership roles. It can aid in identifying the “quiet members” or delegating work to the team to adhere to their strengths and in turn be more efficient.</p>
