    <h2><Strong>A Travel Mobile App</Strong></h2><br>
    <h3>Overview</h3><br>
    <p>Smartphones have become an essential tool for the modern traveller, with multitudes of applications and tools available to improve the travelling experience (Oshins. M 2017). With so many options to choose from, a traveller's phone can become quite cluttered with all sorts of apps ranging from trip planners, accommodation, currency converters and so on. Our application is planned to integrate these features onto one platform. Initially, only a few features will be implemented for ease of design and management, such as a travel planner, a purchasing power budget feature, and geolocation. The app's main attraction is its purchasing power budget feature, which will generate a list of ‘what $ (user amount inputted) can purchase based on the country or city selected.</p><br><br><hr>
    <h3>Motivation</h3><br>
    <p>Prior to the COVID19 pandemic, the Travel and Tourism industry was a huge contributor to the global workforce and GDP. The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) estimates that an estimated 10.6% of jobs worldwide, and 10.4% of global GDP is produced by the industry (WTTC, 2021). Due to COVID19, the industry has been in decline, with the global GDP contribution reduced to 5.5% and a loss of 62 million jobs (WTTC, 2021). While this clearly indicates a lower market for tourism, we believe that once people are able to freely travel again there will be a huge resurgence of tourism worldwide. When this happens, people will be looking for travel apps to help with planning and budgeting in order to best put to use the money they saved during lockdowns, which is what our app will provide. Currently, with a low amount of people travelling worldwide, we have been given the opportunity to spend time developing a travel app that will be ready in time for the inevitable travel boom.</p><br><br><hr>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>How to build a travel app starts with an examination of what is currently available on the market. Today, many travel apps are accessible, each with its own set of features. Assume that an app is a cookie jar and that features are the many flavours of cookies that contribute to the app's deliciousness and appeal to users. The following is a list of the most critical and convenient travel application features. (Matyunina. J 2020)
</p><br>
<h4>Plan a journey with budgeting features</h4><br>
<p>If you are a travel enthusiast, you understand how essential it is to establish a realistic budget for your travels before they begin and do their best to modify their budget. Once a budget is set, travellers may make changes to assist their trip objectives. The previously mentioned tourist-related app elements may be integrated into a single app, but they must be presented orderly and clearly. Allow consumers to track their journey from beginning to end, from flight to the hotel, attraction visit, and return home - an intelligent pocket guide. As a result, consumers may get a better knowledge of their travels. Furthermore, they will have a comprehensive understanding of the expenses that will be incurred throughout the trip. For example, if you plan to spend six months travelling throughout Southeast Asia, you should first study the average cost per day based on your travel style and then establish a budget from there. If you only have $2,000 to spend in six months and realise that you need $7,000, you may want to make adjustments to ensure that you have a better experience on your vacation. You may need to reduce your journey or save more money before embarking on your vacation (Brooks T 2016).
</p><br>
<h4>Purchase Power Feature</h4><br>
<p>For the average traveller, understanding how expenses are going to be allocated during their trip is very useful for planning a budget. As prices for goods and services vary widely from country to country, expenses are not always going to be allocated in the same way. For example, the average amount spent on meals for one day in Hungary is $30AUD, entertainment (museums, attractions, tours) is $31AUD, and a pint of beer is around $1.70AUD. With this information, a traveller could decide that they can afford to allocate more money to entertainment and food, and not have to worry about alcohol prices. The purchase power feature implements this into an easy to use function.
The user will select from three budget styles, low budget, average budget, and high budget. Then the user will choose a country, which will then show 6 categories, displaying the average cost of each category per day, based on the budget type selected.
</p><br>
<h5><i>Budget Style:</i></h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Low Budget - Takeaway and grocery food, hostels, less attractions</li>
    <li>Medium Budget - Average of everything</li>
    <li>High Budget - More expensive restaurants, higher rated hotels, etc.</li>
  </ul><br>
  <h5><i>Categories:</i></h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Food - $30</li>
      <li>Accomodation - $60</li>
      <li>Entertainment (Museums, attractions, tours) $30</li>
      <li>Alcohol - $5</li>
      <li>Public Transportation - $15</li>
      <li>Taxi - $25</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>The user would then be able to enter an amount of money they want to spend in that city, which will be divided between the categories and displayed. Options to exclude categories or prioritize certain categories would be available, through a percentage slider feature.  </p></br>
<h4>Geolocation</h4><br>
<p>Geolocation navigation and maps are critical components of a travel application. 52% of all mobile app users, according to data, use at least one navigation app. This number increases to 85 per cent when visitors are included. Thus, although a map serves as the basis for the customer's application, if they want consumers to use the app's map rather than moving to another navigation tool, the trip map apps must be offline-capable. Moreover, one way to do this is by including a geolocation feature. It is no secret that adding this feature would raise the cost of developing travel software, yet consumers need it even in an MVP or beta version.</p>
<p>With the geolocation feature, the customer will have the ability to easily view places of interest with the option of selecting a price range (based on the budget plans).
  The map will have the 6 previously mentioned categories available as filters, for example if food is selected and the price range selected was High Budget, the map will display restaurants nearby with a higher price range.</p>
<p>Several useful technologies to consider while building a travel application: Google Maps SDK for iOS and Android provides the map directly to the application; Google Places and Facebook Places APIs provide access to an extensive database of services, tourism, and other information.

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Moreover, we must have a programming language (Java, XML for designing the app), operating System (window, Linux), Android Studio, Smartphone, a USB cable for connecting the phone to PC. (Project topics 2019)</p><br>
    <p>This is quite a complex app consisting of a variety of different features. Due to its complexity it is not advised to use changeset-based deployments for its design. As a travel app it would be ideal to make the app compatible with iOS and Android to appeal to the largest possible market.</p><br>
    <p>A good start would be to use a wireframe schematic which is useful to communicate the structure of the app to all team members. As a main feature is analysing purchasing power, there aren’t transactions being processed through the app; cost will be reduced as penetration testing will not need to be as rigorous. This means safety is an appealing aspect to the target audience as any data breaches will not result in financial loss to the user.</p><br><br><hr>
    <h3>Skills requirements</h3><br>
    <p>Here are five skills that a mobile developer must have (Doyle A 2019):</p><br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Analytical Skill:</strong> To build apps that users desire to use, mobile developers must first understand their users' requirements. The ability to evaluate how people use their mobile devices is essential for a successful mobile developer.</li>
      <li><strong>Communication Skill:</strong> Mobile developers must be able to communicate both verbally and in writing. If they are hired to develop a mobile app, they must be able to ask the appropriate questions of the customer in order to understand what the client wants and requires. Developers must also be able to provide directions to team members or workers and explain an application to non-technical team members or customers. This needs the capacity to convey complex ideas in simple, easy-to-understand language.</li>
      <li><strong>Creativity Skill:</strong> As a mobile developer, they must write clean code to build user-friendly apps. This work requires not just technical abilities but also an open mind. Developers think imaginatively about how consumers integrate their mobile devices into their life and then create apps that assist them in completing different activities.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem Solving Skill:</strong> As a mobile developer, the developer will spend a significant amount of time troubleshooting apps on the Android or iOS platforms. The developer must be able to identify different technical issues and understand how to fix them.</li>
      <li><strong>Programming Languages Skill:</strong> A mobile developer must be fluent in at least one programming language. Apple iOS developers usually use Objective-C, whereas Android developers often use Java. However, knowing several programming languages is beneficial. This will set the developer apart from the other job candidates.</li>
    </ul><br><br><hr>

    <h3>Outcome</h3><br>
    <p>The Smart Trip Guide will help clients overcome challenges when travelling and keep in touch with their travel companions. The programme will be in constant conversation with the user, sharing nearby facts and information to make the user's experience simpler. Furthermore, this programme can be used as an intelligent system to assist the user even more. Even while in an unknown environment, a person can be aware of their surroundings. Because of the methods adopted, this programme has the potential to be used as an intelligent emergency aid application. Instead of informing everyone or a specific group of contacts, the algorithm in use can alert the user's nearest contact (Badekar N et al. 2015) The software may also be used as a companion app, which means it can assist travellers to meet new people while they move from one destination to another.
