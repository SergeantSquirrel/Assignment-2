<p>Our team performed admirably in this evaluation. Every member of the team performs admirably in their assigned role. In my opinion, I haven't contributed much to the coding problem of creating a website with GitHub, so I'll work on it more. One thing that surprised me was that, even though no one in the group knew each other or had previously worked together, the problem of dividing each person's work went smoothly. Working with my team members allows me to learn much other helpful knowledge, although I do not have an essential background in information technology. In this assessment, I handled the IT technology portion, which included issues relating to the Cloud, servers, and services. Furthermore, my project idea part was chosen in this session, and when I received feedback from the teacher from the first assessment, I made changes to my post to improve it. Furthermore, our team has up to 5  meetings per week to assign each member's work and report on each person's work to solve problems together if anyone has difficulties with their assigned work.

<p>Our team started halfway through but somehow managed to finish the project in time. I felt anxious in the first place to work in such a big group compared to my other subjects’ group assignment but luckily everyone did their part well and was friendly enough to help each other in the process. Working in groups sometimes post inconvenience such as communication breakdown where it is hard to keep everyone on the same page. On top of that, we need to arrange meet-ups and set deadlines to function effectively while this could be time consuming and requires pre-planning. However, I have learnt some valuable things through this group project such as improved communication skills and how to manage work conflicts effectively. I personally felt the team progress is slowing down towards the end and I recommend everyone be more contributive in the group work and keeps the momentum as some team members do not contribute much. I also personally felt that our group's lack of planning causes us to hit the deadline just in time which is not an ideal practice and we should pay more attention to it in the next project. Furthermore, tasks should be assigned specifically to individuals instead of assigning to any team members who are free.  Fortunately, everyone shows up to the meetings and at least finishes their part on time.

<p>I felt like we had a late start to rolling. It was out of our control as members, including myself, were quite busy through mid semester break. Our first meeting was less than 2 weeks from the due date. As a team I felt we were able to smoothly divide the work among ourselves and no one hesitated to volunteer for their share of work. Our progress was surprisingly quick in the first week. We set internal deadlines and have a large majority of the content completed. This was because we knew there would be changes once we got our marks back from assignment 1 and wanted plenty of cushion room to make those changes; also, drafting the report and creating the website would need a comfortable amount of time assigned to it. Communication was a struggle to begin with. I felt like meetings were twice as long as they should have been, but seemed to improve over the weeks which was good to see. The pace slowed down in the last week heading to the due date, but I still felt comfortable that the work would be done in good time.

<p>Our team took a bit of time to initially start the assignment, but in our first meeting we were able to delegate tasks to each member and set a due date for such tasks. I was impressed with everyone’s effort in finishing their delegated task by the due date we set. Because of this we managed to finish the biggest section in the assignment which bought us an extra week to finish smaller parts of the assignment. We struggled with meetings at first, as it seemed that everyone would wait for someone to run the meeting and delegate tasks to each other, though towards the end the group dynamic was understood. I learned that sometimes someone has to always take charge, it doesn't necessarily make them bossy. For the next assignment, I think we should aim at sticking to a meeting agenda so meetings can be short and concise, as well as ensuring we have an early meeting to delegate tasks so everyone can have something to work on if they want to start the assignment earlier.

<p>The team performed really well in terms of meeting deadlines from the ease of communication between all group members. Members were all assigned tasks and given soft deadlines , giving a buffer for improvements before the hard deadline. Initially , communication between group members was quite difficult due to our introverted personalities , though everyone came together towards the common goal of finishing the project and their part once we all became more comfortable. On my part to be honest , I should have had more involvement regarding the CSS and HTML. From my poor time management of juggling between two assignments , I have contributed less than I should have. Overall from this project , I have learnt the importance of communication and I felt that my time management skills have improved since the usage of soft deadlines. For improvements on future projects , I think better planning skills can be implemented as we were quite delayed from waiting for feedback on a relevant piece of information in a related assignment.
